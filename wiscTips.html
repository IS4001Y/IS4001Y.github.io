  			<h1><u>WISc Tips & Tricks</u></h1>

	<p>Surviving WISc can certainly seem like a daunting task at times. And there are a few other survival guides you can take a look at on this site! But here are a few tips of my own.</p>
	<p>The first tip that I think is very important is that you should try to talk to upper year students if you need advice or have questions. This can be about anything. Maybe you are just curious about what courses to expect in the future, what professors to take (or avoid), or advice on how to get a certain position. Most students are happy to help you out and talk about their experiences (if they’re not in the middle of working).</p>
	<p>With that first tip in mind, I also advise you to go and visit the WISc lounge! This is a great place to meet students from other years and talk with them. Even better, if you have a particular WISc assignment you’re working on, you’ll be able to ask older students or your classmates for help if you’re stuck. Besides that, the lounge is just a great place to work - it has a printer, and sometimes free snacks. But mostly, it’s just a great place to get to know everyone else and hang out outside of class. I have personally spent many hours there just working between classes and eating lunch.

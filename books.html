  			<h1><u>Buying Books</u></h1>

	<p>Book-buying at Western is fairly straightforward, but I have a few tips to share. For one, just because the book is listed in the syllabus, it doesn’t mean you have to buy it! Always wait until the first class to buy your textbooks. The professor will usually let you know if you are able to borrow the book from the library, buy a used/older version, or if you need it at all. In some cases, they may tell you that it is absolutely necessary that you buy it. This usually happens when you need a unique access code to receive the material, and is non-negotiable.</p>
	<p>However, if you do not need an access code, and simply would like to read the textbook, there are options for a discount. For one, if you prefer a physical copy, it is always best to check if used versions are available. The Bookstore offers some, but it is usually not heavily discounted. Instead, I suggest checking online sources such as Facebook groups (‘UWO Used Textbooks For Sale’) to see who may be offering one.</p> 
<p>Additionally, if you don’t need a physical copy, there are plenty of online sources to get textbook PDFs for free! My personal favourite is <a href="http://libgen.rs/">LibGen</a>. Obviously, this is subject to availability, and the quality is not always perfect, but I often prefer it over paying hundreds of dollars where possible.</p>

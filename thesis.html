  			<h1><u>4th Year Thesis Projects</u></h1>

	<p>The 4th year thesis project is required to complete as part of a WISc degree. You will get more information about this from your 3rd year WISc professors, but it never hurts to think ahead about what project you might like, and which professor to ask to be your supervisor.</p>
<p>If you have any urgent, specific questions, I encourage you to contact the current course supervisor. Just look up the course outline for 4999E to find out their information (and also read about the course!).</p>
<p>Finding a professor to be your supervisor is a process which usually begins as early as December in your 3rd year. All you have to do is reach out to any professor who you might be interested in, and ask them if they are currently accepting thesis students for next year. If they say yes, they will likely tell you more about their lab, and the type of research that they do. They might also ask you to talk a bit about yourself, or send your CV, in order to get an idea if you will be a good fit for them. That being said, this is not meant to be a stressful or interview-like process. It is just to make sure that your interests align, and you both make a good match! After all, you’re going to be working closely together for the next year.</p>
<p>It is best to start talking to supervisors as early as possible. This means around December or January in your 3rd year. Spots can fill up quickly, especially with popular professors. It is also completely acceptable to talk to more than one professor at the same time! This is a time for you to find out what you will enjoy, as well. So ask around, and find out what research each professor works on, or if they have any recommendations of other professors. Many will be happy to suggest some other people for you to talk to.</p>
<p>Once you have chosen your supervisor, make sure to let them officially know. There may be also some forms to fill out with the course administrator over the summer months. Over the summer, or in September, you will work with your supervisor to decide what your project will be. This will almost always be dictated by your supervisor’s main areas of interest in their lab - which is why your supervisor selection is so important! However, there is some flexibility to work with them and refine your topic so that it is something you find interesting.</p>
<p>From there, the course administrator will provide guidelines for upcoming deadlines. It’s up to you to conduct your study now. Good luck!

  			<h1><u>WISc Benefits at Western</u></h1>

	<p>Aside from all of the benefits that WISc can give you in terms of career, grad school, and overall good education, there are also some aspects I appreciate that you can take advantage of while at university.</p>
<p>One of the most important benefits that I encourage you to take advantage of is the lounge. The lounge is currently located in the Collip Building. Not only is this a great place to sit and study, but it also has the added benefit of being occasionally stocked with extra treats. In optimal conditions, the lounge will have assorted coffee and tea products available, which can be prepared with the kettle. Again, these products are subject to availability, and are currently stocked out of the goodness in Dr. Felix Lee’s heart. If you are polite to other residents in the Collip Building, they may even throw in some additional resources (such as candy on Halloween). The other good part about the lounge is the access to a free printer! Never again pay for printing in the library, which is a pain and a rip-off.</p>
<p>The other great benefit to being part of the WISc program is the fact that you will be working closely with your cohort over the course of your degree. You will generally see the same people in the same WISc-specific courses over the years, which is rare in many university courses. This gives you a unique group of classmates and friends, which I have really come to appreciate. You will also get to work with some of the same professors over the years, which allows them to get to know you, and provide valuable support and advice.

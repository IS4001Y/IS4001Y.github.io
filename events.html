  			<h1><u>Special Events to See</u></h1>

	<p>When I first started at university, I always felt like there was so much going on that I didn’t know about! It’s true, some events are not well advertised, and are just tradition. Here is a list of things that you might not otherwise know about:</p>

        <h2>1. Wednesday Night Rick’s</h2>
<p>If somebody asks you “Do you want to go to Rick’s on Wednesday?”, they’re asking if you want to go see Rick McGhie perform at the Spoke. Every Wednesday night, Rick will play a string of favourites on his guitar, and sing for the crowd. He is - without exaggeration - a legendary Western figure, who has been faithfully playing these weekly shows for decades. The best thing to do is to grab some friends and stake out an early seat! It gets incredibly busy, but be prepared for a fun, loud, sing-along night. For those who drink alcohol, the Spoke also serves drinks. Also note, the event is 19+ and ID must be shown at the entrance for this reason.</p>

        <h2>2. Western Film</h2>
<p>You might not know this, but there is a full movie theatre on campus! Of course, it only shows one movie at a time, but it offers a great show, nonetheless. With a mix of new releases and old classics, Western Film puts on a great selection of movies throughout the week. And the tickets are cheaper than many public theatres - with discounted prices for students, and even more discounts on Tuesdays. Just like a regular theatre, there is a full concession stand to grab popcorn, drinks, and snacks. If you’re interested, Western Film can be found on the 2nd floor of the UCC, by the entrance to the Wave. Its movie schedule, along with other information, can be found <a href="https://westernfilm.online/">here</a>. </p>

        <h2>3. McIntosh Gallery</h2>
<p>Although this building is right in the middle of campus, it can be easy to overlook! McIntosh Gallery is the small building found between the Social Science Centre and the Physics and Astronomy Building. Often, local artwork, sculptures, or interactive exhibits will be displayed inside. Admission is free, and you are welcome to enter and walk around! It doesn’t take long to explore the entire exhibit, so it may just be an interesting place to stop for a few minutes as you make your way across campus. Definitely worth a visit! Find out more <a href="https://mcintoshgallery.ca/">here</a>.  </p>

        <h2>4. Music Student Showcase</h2>
<p>This one is an especially little-known event. At certain points during the year, music students will have the opportunity to showcase their talents to an audience. A program of multiple students perform throughout the event. Often, one event will be for one specialty (eg. opera singing, classical instruments, etc.) Admission is free and open to everyone, although please note that this is a relatively important event for the students, and a nicer style of dress is preferred out of respect. These performances are held inside the Don Wright Faculty of Music Building. To find out more about the schedule, click <a href="https://music.uwo.ca/events/index.html">here</a>. </p>

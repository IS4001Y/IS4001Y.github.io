  			<h1><u>Tips for Studying</u></h1>

	<p>Whether you are new to university or have been around for a few years, it never hurts to get a few tips on how to study.</p>
	<p>One of the most important things is to set a routine, and figure out what habits work best for you. Some people study best in groups, but others work best alone. Aside from the obvious, it could be helpful to also try new ways of absorbing information that work for you. For example, you might find that even though you’ve always studied by writing notes, you actually study best by explaining the topic out loud to someone! Try and experiment with different methods that you haven’t tried before, if you find that your current study habits are difficult to work with.</p>
	<p>Another important thing to remember when studying is to maintain a balance. It might feel best to study for 10 hours straight, but it might not be the most efficient way to retain information. Not to mention, it can be stressful! If you have the time, try and space out your studying in smaller hour blocks over a number of days, or at least with a break in between. This will help you retain topics better instead of cramming.</p>
	<p>One last tip is to genuinely go to office hours. A lot of students find professors intimidating and don’t want to bother them, but office hours are for you! Professors want you to succeed, I promise. So if you’re stuck on a topic, don’t be afraid to reach out to them for help. Often it can also be less pressure to talk to them one-on-one instead of asking a question in front of the whole class.

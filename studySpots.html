  			<h1><u>The Best Study Spots at Western</u></h1>

  	
	<p> Whether you prefer to study in a quiet, secluded area, or a busy room with activity, the variety of on-campus study spots can offer it all. Here, I will highlight a few of the most popular locations to get your work done. If you’re feeling more adventurous, however, most buildings on campus are well-equipped with tables, and I encourage you to explore and find your own favourite spot!</p>

	<h2>1. D.B. Weldon Library (Weldon)</h2>
	<p>Ah, classic Weldon. This is the absolute most popular location for studying, likely due to the library’s large size and central location on campus. Here, you can find a variety of silent, quiet, or conversation-friendly study zones, based on which location you choose to study in. Zones are spread out across the building’s 5 stories! Due to the large space, it is usually not difficult to find a spot to study here, unless it is during peak exam season. Weldon also offers you the ability to book your own private room (see ‘Booking a Room’ below to find out how). And best of all, if you get hungry while studying, you can also find Argo Tea Cafe located on the first floor.</p>

	<h2>2. Allyn & Betty Taylor Library (Taylor)</h2>
	<p>Behind Weldon, Taylor Library is contested to be one of the top picks for study locations on campus. Many science students actually prefer Taylor over Weldon due to its proximity to buildings like Physics and Astronomy (PAB) and Natural Sciences Centre! This building is much smaller than Weldon, so it may be more difficult to find a spot here, but it is well worth it. Another strong attraction to studying here is the presence of multiple food options! You might go to the classic Tim Hortons for a quick coffee break, or other restaurants such as Pizza Pizza. Or, if you don’t want to wait in line for Tims (which can get quite long), you can visit my personal favourite - Einstein’s Cafe, found right at the entrance to Taylor. Just like at Weldon, you can book personal study spaces here (see ‘Booking a Room’ to find out more). </p>

	<h2>3. John & Dotsa Bitove Family Law Library (The Law Library)</h2>
	<p>While this space is generally used by Western Law students, it is open for anyone to use! It enjoyed a brief period in the spotlight last year when students realized this picturesque location was available to them. However, the rush has since died down, and it should be moderately easy to find a spot here on a good day. As mentioned, the Law Library is most attractive as a study location due to its classic feel and beautiful, wood-paneled interior. This spot is more likely to be quiet or silent-study only. </p>

	<h2>4. The Affiliate Colleges</h2>
	<p>Western has three affiliate university colleges: Brescia, Huron, and Kings University College. They are found around the outskirts of Western, and are not considered part of ‘Main’ campus. However, their buildings are open to all Western students, and they can offer some excellent study spots. Do not expect them to be less busy than on-campus spots, though, as they are still used by their home students! Many study spots at these affiliate colleges will also be near a dining center, as an added bonus.</p>

	<h2>5. University Community Centre (UCC)</h2>
	<p>The UCC is an excellent place to study if you’re looking for a busier area! There are many tables spread around the building, on all four levels (including a basement). You might consider studying in the cafeteria court, or perhaps inside the Spoke. I personally enjoy studying by the window here. You can also explore the upper levels of the UCC, where tables are scattered about the atrium. Finally, you can always investigate the basement of the UCC, where you might get lucky and find an empty classroom to sit in. The doors are usually unlocked, and you are allowed to use ones which are unoccupied (although you must give it up to someone who has it booked, or a class). Empty classrooms are particularly useful for practicing group presentations, or if you need a large space to use.</p>

	<h2>6. The WISc Lounge</h2>
	<p>Finally, the WISc Lounge is one of the perfect places to study as a WISc student! I personally enjoy studying here when working on WISc-specific assignments in order to get help and feedback from other people working on the same thing. It can be extremely helpful to ask others for help if you are stuck on a tricky question! The lounge is also equipped with whiteboards, a printer, and basic supplies. This usually means you have everything you need within the room.</p>

	<h2>Booking a Room</h2>
	<p>As mentioned, you can book study rooms at many locations on campus. To do so is easy! Simply go to this <a href="https://calendar.lib.uwo.ca/allspaces">link</a>. You should be able to use the navigation bar to select the study room that you want to book. Then, all you have to do is show up for your designated time.

	Although I discussed a number of great study spots so far, there are many more to choose from. Look around for your personal favourites, or read <a href ="https://westerngazette.ca/culture/unconventional-study-spots-on-campus/article_1404d1fa-7d41-11e7-823a-afe6d1be6f90.html">this article</a> from the Gazette for even more ideas. </p>

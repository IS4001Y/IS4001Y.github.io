  			<h1><u>Clubs & Recreation at Western</u></h1>

	<p>School doesn’t always have to be about just classes. There are a lot of fun clubs and extracurriculars to join too!</p> 
	<p>If you are interested in joining a club, the best way to learn about them and join up is during Clubs Week. Clubs Week usually runs during the first few weeks of the year at the UCC, and every club will set up their own booth. Like a giant fair, you will be able to walk around and talk to representatives from each of these clubs to find out which ones you are interested to join. But, if you want to learn about clubs at any other time, another great resource is their <a href="https://westernu.campuslabs.ca/engage/organizations">USC page</a>. All clubs have their description posted here for you to learn more.</p>
<p>If you do decide to join a club, some might be free to join, but others may require a fee. This is usually less than $20 (but depends on the club), and goes towards funding club events. The commitment is also variable, depending on the club! Some clubs focus on producing yearly events, while others meet weekly to discuss certain topics. There is a huge variety, so make sure to learn about all of them and pick a couple you are interested in. Registration for clubs is generally open throughout the year, but it is far easier to get integrated if you join at the beginning. Also, some clubs may have positions that fill up early on, or teams which have already been decided - so this is not a rule for all of them.</p>
<p>If, instead of clubs, you’d rather join a physical sport, Western has that too! At the Rec Centre, Western hosts Intramural sports, and many fitness classes. For more information on Intramurals, click <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/campusrec/intramurals/index.html">here</a>; and for fitness classes, click <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/campusrec/programs/index.html">here</a>. Both options usually require a fee in order to participate. </p>

  			<h1><u>Scholarships at Western</u></h1>

	<p>Scholarships are an important part of financial aid when attending Western. As far as I know, there are two types of scholarships readily available: those which are automatically applied to your tuition, and those which much be applied for.</p> 
	<p>Scholarships can be applied to your tuition without you having to do anything, and will be visible under your account statement on Student Centre. Usually, these scholarships will be based on some sort of academic achievement, including meeting a minimum grade threshold in the previous year. Others may be for top marks, or other particular achievements in a course.</p> 
	<p>Other scholarships must be applied for. You can find a complete list of them <a href="https://studentservices.uwo.ca/secure/Awards/index.cfm">here</a>. This does not include some need-based funds, which occur through a separate application process. Make sure to look at this list and go for any that apply to you. Not many people take the time to fill out these applications, and that gives you an advantage. It never hurts to just apply, you never know!

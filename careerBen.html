  			<h1><u>Career Benefits from WISc</u></h1>

	<p>One of the major benefits to being in the WISc program is that it can help you in your future career.</p>
	<p>For one, WISc teaches you a lot of transferable skills. There is a lot of group work in WISc courses, and it will allow you to get plenty of experience working with a team. The amount of projects will also allow you to learn project management skills. Perhaps the best example of this will come in the 4th year thesis project, which is required for a WISc degree. This intensive project will let you develop excellent initiative, problem-solving, and independent work skills. All of these skills are very helpful for future careers, and can be used on your resume.</p>
	<p>One other benefit, as mentioned elsewhere, is that being a part of WISc means that you will work closely with certain professors, who will get to know you well. This is an advantage because you can use them as positive references for when you are applying for jobs.</p>
	<p>Lastly, the whole idea of WISc is that you will need to become accustomed to synthesizing lots of new information and forming connections between different topics. You will learn to be flexible with learning, and understanding things deeper, hopefully. Again, these are great skills to be able to put on your resume and take into the workforce.

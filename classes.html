  			<h1><u>Choosing Classes</u></h1>

	<p>Choosing classes can feel like an endlessly stressful task, with the myriad of options to select from. But don’t worry, it doesn’t have to be so hard. I’m going to talk to you about the requirements you should meet, but the flexibility you can have, when choosing classes.</p>
	<p>For one, you should always make sure you are meeting the course requirements for your degree. You can check these by going <a href="https://www.westerncalendar.uwo.ca/Archive/2017/2017/pg1921.html">here</a>. Scroll down and select your specialization (eg. ‘with Biology’) to see your full program-specific requirements. Always take note of what requirements you might need in order to take upper-year courses, as well. Requirements are usually found by looking up that course’s outline.</p>
	Another important aspect that is not often communicated is your breadth requirements. As stated <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/arts/counselling/your_degree/breadth_requirements.html">here</a>, in order to graduate, you must have 1.0 credits (usually two 1-semester courses, or 1 full-year course) from the listed A, B, and C categories.
	If you are ever unsure if you are meeting your requirements and on track to graduate, it is completely acceptable to email academic counselling and ask them to check for you.
	Now comes the fun part. You have a lot of freedom with choosing courses, outside of these requirements! When looking at other courses, however, make sure to check a few things to ensure you’re allowed to enrol. For example, you will need to check that you have completed the prerequisite courses. Also, some courses are fully restricted to students who are in a certain program (eg. Ivey), in which case you will not be able to enrol. But aside from these, you can take any course you like! I have personally enjoyed exploring courses outside of science, and took introductory classes in philosophy, history, and business. 
	What do you do if you don’t like a course? Or what if you want to just try it out, and not have it count? There are a couple of options here as well. If you decide you don’t like a course within the first 1-2 weeks of class, you may be able to switch it by the Add/Drop deadline. The deadline is posted yearly by academic counselling, and you have until that point to swap or drop any course you don’t like. Additionally, you can consider making your class a Discovery credit. More information can be found <a href="https://www.westerncalendar.uwo.ca/PolicyPages.cfm?Command=showCategory&PolicyCategoryID=5&SelectedCalendar=Live&ArchiveID=#Page_69">here</a>. Basically, any course you like can be transformed into a Pass/Fail marking scheme instead of a number grade. However, this should not be done for your required module courses! Only for courses outside of your program that you are interested in studying without worrying about the grade.</p>

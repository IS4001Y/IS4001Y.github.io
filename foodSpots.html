  			<h1><u>Best Food Spots on Campus</u></h1>

	<p>Western has many options for you to grab a snack or meal while on campus. You can also use your Western ONE Card to pay at most of these locations. Here are just a few of the top spots you should know about when you want something to eat! This does not include, of course, more obvious locations like the UCC main cafeteria, and residence dining halls.</p>

        <h2>1. The Spoke</h2>
<p>Unquestionably, the Spoke is the most iconic eatery on campus. It is almost a rite of passage to grab your very own bagel here. While the side closest to the UCC atrium serves cafe items (and the infamous bagels), if you venture further inside the Spoke you will also find its restaurant counterpart by the bar. This is helpful if you’re looking for a larger meal. This side of the Spoke offers meals like burgers, chicken strips, quesadillas, and (in my opinion) the best fries ever.</p>

        <h2>2. The Grad Club</h2>
<p>This is more of a hidden spot, for those unfamiliar with it. Some people tend to find it by accident, as The Grad Club is quietly tucked away in the basement of Middlesex College. You may be surprised to know how busy it can get, when it’s so out of the way! But this spot is very popular (not just with Grad students), and even offers nice patio seating in warmer months. The Grad Club serves full meals and alcoholic drinks.</p>

        <h2>3. The Wave</h2>
<p>With both being found in the UCC, I like to think of the Wave as the Spoke’s older sibling. The Wave has seated dining and is a full-scale restaurant. It also features a full bar. This is a good place to go with friends for dinner. With sit-down service, it’s a little harder to squeeze in between classes.</p>

        <h2>4. Green Leaf Cafe</h2>
<p>If you have class in Somerville House or Thames Hall, you should know about Green Leaf Cafe, found on the first floor. This is the perfect place to grab ready-made sandwiches and other cafe items, as well as a quick coffee or tea. I have tried and tested the ability to grab a full meal in-between classes in under a minute. For those with an extra minute, the cafe also serves behind-the-counter meals like pho, ramen, and soups, among other things.</p>

        <h2>5. Natural Science Tim Hortons</h2>
<p>One of my favourite spots on campus - partly because of its convenient location, and partly because it’s Tim Hortons - is the Tim’s inside the Natural Science Centre. It is also located directly next to Taylor Library, which makes it extra-convenient to grab a coffee in the middle of studying.
These are just some highlights. There are, of course, a number of other possible locations. You can find a complete list of places to eat here: https://mealplan.uwo.ca/dining.cfm. As well, don’t forget the Western ONE Card works at any residence - not just your own. That includes at any of the affiliate colleges (Brescia, Huron, or Kings).</p>

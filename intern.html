  			<h1><u>3rd Year Science Intership</u></h1>

	<p>During your time at Western, you will be able to apply for a ‘3rd Year Science Internship’. This is a position that happens after your 3rd year and before your 4th year. Information for this opportunity will start being emailed out around the start of 3rd year, so that you have time to prepare. One of the major requirements to be eligible for the internship is to have at least a 70% average in 2nd year. </p>
	<p>Read more about this opportunity and the requirement <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/sci/undergraduate/careers_and_internships/science_internship_program/index.html">here</a>.</p>
	A lot of information will be broadcast to you over email during 3rd year, so you don’t need to worry about missing out. Once you decide to apply, you will need to attend a number of information sessions and workshops during your 3rd year.
	You’ll be responsible for finding your own internship project, but usually a database of open positions is provided for you to choose from. The length of the internship depends on the specific position, but will generally be about 1 year. Think of it as if instead of taking school for a year, you’re doing an internship. It is great experience and I recommend you consider doing this!
